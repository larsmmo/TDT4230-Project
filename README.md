TDT4235 Project by Lars Martin Moe

To build:

1) Navigate to /build folder and write cmake ..
2) Build solution (visual studio used)
3) run raymarching.exe located in the build directory

The project uses a watered down version of the gloom framework. If it doesn't work, just try copying src files to the default gloom framework.
